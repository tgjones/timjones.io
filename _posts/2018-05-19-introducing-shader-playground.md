**TL/DR: I've made a new website called [Shader Playground](http://shader-playground.timjones.io) that is sort of like [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) but for shading languages. You can compile HLSL and GLSL using `fxc.exe`, `dxc.exe`, `glslangValidator.exe`, `spirv-cross.exe`, and `mali-sc.exe`. You can see the compiler output and disassembly. You can chain multiple shader compilers together to transpile one language to another. You can share permalinks to shaders.**

As you may know, I am very interested in shaders and shading languages ([exhibit A](/blog/archive/2010/12/30/stitchup-in-action), [exhibit B](/blog/archive/2014/01/07/introducing-hlslunit-unit-tests-for-your-hlsl-shader-code), [exhibit C](/blog/archive/2014/11/24/getting-started-with-jetbrains-nitra), [exhibit D](/blog/archive/2015/09/02/parsing-direct3d-shader-bytecode), [exhibit E](/blog/archive/2015/10/06/introducing-hlsl-tools-for-visual-studio)). I frequently want to test little bits of shader syntax to see what the compiler does. That was why I made the [Try HLSL](/blog/archive/2017/02/11/try-hlsl-online) website, first for myself and then I put it online last year. It was really very simple - type or paste HLSL code on the left, choose whether to compile with the old (`fxc.exe`) or new (`dxc.exe`) HLSL compilers, and see the disassembly (or compiler errors) on the right. It's been quite popular - I don't have stats on it, but [my recent tweet](https://twitter.com/_tim_jones_/status/984034078788870144) about it was RT'd quite a bit, so I think this is something that people find useful.

However, the Try HLSL website was always a bit limited. It only worked with HLSL, and it only worked with Microsoft's two HLSL compilers. Given the diversity of today's shader landscape (GLSL, SPIR-V, Metal, etc.), I wanted to make it better. So I did.

Let me first list the features:

* **Multiple input languages** (HLSL and GLSL, with the potential for more in the future)
* **Multiple compilers**:
  * `fxc.exe`
  * `dxc.exe`
  * `glslangValidator.exe`
  * `spirv-cross.exe`
  * `mali-sc.exe`
* **Compiler chaining**: create multiple compilation steps, so you can pipe HLSL to SPIR-V to Metal, for example.
* **Permalinks**: share links to a specific "playground", with input code and all the compilation steps saved.

Now I'll go into more detail on some of these.

## Compilers

The old Try HLSL site only supported Microsoft's old and new HLSL compilers, so with Shader Playground I wanted to expand that. You can now access the following compilers. The exact ones shown in the dropdown will depend on the input language you have selected.

* [FXC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb232919(v=vs.85).aspx) - `fxc.exe`, Microsoft's legacy HLSL compiler
* [DXC](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) - `dxc.exe`, Microsoft's new open-source HLSL compiler
* [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) - `glslangValidator.exe`, Khronos's reference GLSL compiler that also now has an HLSL frontend
* [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross) - `spirv-cross.exe`, Khronos's tool for disassembling SPIR-V back into high level languages (GLSL, HLSL, Metal, C++)
* [Mali offline compiler](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/graphics-development-tools/mali-offline-compiler) - `mali-sc.exe`, ARM's offline compiler tool

## Compiler chaining

When a compiler outputs a language (or binary format) that can be fed into another compiler, you get an "Add Compiler" button. Click this, and you'll be able to chain together up to 5 compilers. Here's an example of compiling HLSL using DXC, outputting SPIR-V, piping that into SPIRV-Cross, and outputting Metal:

{% responsive_image path: assets/posts/shader-playground-compiler-chaining.png alt: "Screenshot of compiler chaining" %}

You get the idea. Here are the current compilers with their input and output languages. I plan to add more to this list:

* FXC
  * Inputs:
    * HLSL
  * Outputs:
    * DXBC
* DXC
  * Inputs:
    * HLSL
  * Outputs:
    * DXIL
    * SPIR-V
* glslangValidator
  * Inputs:
    * GLSL
    * HLSL
  * Outputs:
    * SPIR-V
* SPIRV-Cross
  * Inputs:
    * SPIR-V
  * Outputs:
    * GLSL
    * Metal
    * HLSL
    * C++
* Mali offline compiler
  * Inputs:
    * GLSL
    * SPIR-V
  * Outputs:
    * [None]

You can use any valid combination of these, although right now that basically means using SPIRV-Cross somewhere in the chain.

Some compilers have multiple outputs. When using DXC or glslang, for example, you can view the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the compiler:

With all compilers you can view the compiler output as well as the disassembly.

## Permalinks

Want to share a link to a shader? Once you've got everything setup (with whatever input code and compilers and parameters you want), click the "Share Permalink" button at the top-right:

{% responsive_image path: assets/posts/shader-playground-permalink.png alt: "Screenshot of Share Permalink button" %}

That will open a dialog, and after a short wait you'll get a URL that you can copy:

## How it works

I wrote this site in C#, using ASP.NET Core. [The source code is up on GitHub](https://github.com/tgjones/shader-playground). It's hosted in Azure as an App Service (not on the free plan, for reasons, so if it gets popular I might start a Patreon...). In most cases I'm calling out to the backend shader compilers using `Process.Start(...)`, which is a bit scary because compiler options that you select on the site are passed as command line parameters to the backend compilers. I'm validating the input as best I can, and there's a timeout on running the process, but still... please don't break it.

I'm using GitHub Gists as the "database" for permalinks. There's a rate limit on the GitHub API that could theoretically be hit, but I think it will be fine. If it's not I'll have to think of something else.

## Future

Next, I plan to add more compilers:

* [Radeon GPU Analyzer (RGA)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/RGA)
* [HLSLcc](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/HLSLcc)
* [PowerVR](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/tools/pvrshadereditor/)
* [GLSL optimizer](https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer)
* [hlsl2glslfork](https://github.com/aras-p/hlsl2glslfork)
* [HLSLParser](https://github.com/Thekla/hlslparser)
* [Slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang)

If you have a particular compiler that you'd like me to prioritise adding, please let me know.

Or if you want to dig in yourself, the whole Shader Playground website is [open source and on GitHub](https://github.com/tgjones/shader-playground). Contributions or feature suggestions are welcome! Bug reports are less welcome but still appreciated :)

And a grab bag of other things I'm thinking about:

* I'd also like to support multiple versions per compiler, so for example for `dxc.exe`, you'd be able to compare the outputs of multiple versions of that compiler, as it develops.
* I'd like to add support for Unity shaders, but [it's not at all straightforward](https://twitter.com/_tim_jones_/status/993813451276369921), if it's possible at all.
* The mobile version of the site is functional, but not ideal. My web dev knowledge is a bit out of date these days, so I need to brush up on flexbox in order to get things working how I want.

If you want an offline version of Shader Playground, I highly recommend looking at Josh Barczak's [Pyramid Shader Analyzer](https://github.com/jbarczak/Pyramid). I got a lot of inspiration from that project, so thank you Josh.
